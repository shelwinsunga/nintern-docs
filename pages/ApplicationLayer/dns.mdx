# DNS

DNS, or **domain name system**, is all about identifiers. As a person, you probably have a lot of identifiers associated with yourself. 
Your name, your Social Security Number, your passport, and your employee ID are just a few examples. 

We've also already seen that Internet hosts have identifiers as well. It has an IP address, and it has a "name", e.g., nagios.com. 

The role of DNS is to provide a sense of mapping for IP addresses and the human names we ascribe it. 

DNS is a *distributed database* spread all over the internet. It's important to note that the DNS is an application-layer service, meaning it's implemented by servers at the network edge, rather than 
routers and switches that sit in the network. This reflects the internet's design philosophy of putting complexity at the network's edge, and keeping the core of the network simple. 

## DNS: Services

There are a number of services that DNS does for us. There is of course taking our hostname, so any random website like www.youtube.com, and being able to translate that into an IP address.
There's aliasing for hosts and mail servers, meaning that we turn some external facing name to a much more cryptic internal one. 

Another important one is load balancing.

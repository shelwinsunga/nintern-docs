# Email

We're going to focus on the infrastructure of emailing, and we're going to focus on SMPT (Simple Mail transfer protocol).

As a distributed application, email has three components:

- User agents
- Mail servers
- SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol

## User agents

The user agent, which can also be called the mail client, is what you use to do things like compose, read, and edit emails. Some examples might be gmail, outlook, or your phone mail app. 
The messages you read or create with the client is stored on Mail servers.

## Mail servers

Mail servers have a *mailbox* and a *message queue*. The mailbox contains the incoming messages for the users. The message queue is a queue of messages that the Mail Server is waiting to send.

## SMTP

This is used between mail servers to send email messages. The client would be the sending mail server, and the server would be the receiving mail server.

# The Web and HTTP

As we discuss the Web and HTTP, remember that web pages consist of **objects**, each of which can be stored on different servers. This object can be an HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, etc. 


##  HTTP Overview

**HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol**

HTTP is the Web's application layer protocol. It uses a client-server model. A client could be a web browser like firefox or safari, or it might be embedded in the device. The server sends objects in response to requests.



Take for instance a PC running Firefox. The client (Firefox) will send a kind HTTP request to the Web server. The Web server afterwards, if the world is at peace, will send back an HTTP response.

HTTP uses the transport services provided by the **TCP** protocol. The client will open a TCP connection to a web server (creating a socket) using port 80. The server accepts the TCP connection, the client and server will exchange messages, and then the TCP connection will close.

HTTP is a *stateless* protocol. This means that it doesn't have any information about past client requests. There's a single request, and a single response. You might wonder why it's stateless, and its because of its simplicity. Protocols that have to think of states will be more complex - needing to think about cleanup in the 
case that the transaction fails.

## HTTP connections: two types

### Non-persistent HTTP

In a non-persistent HTTP connection, a TCP connection is opened and at most one object is sent over the TCP connection. Then, it closes. This means that downloading multiple objects requires multiple TCP connections.

### Persistent HTTP

In a persistent HTTP connection, a TCP connection is opened and multiple objects can be sent over this single TCP connection. Afterwards, the TCP connection closes.

# The Web and HTTP

As we discuss the Web and HTTP, remember that web pages consist of **objects**, each of which can be stored on different servers. This object can be an HTML file, JPEG image, Java applet, audio file, etc. 


##  HTTP Overview

**HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol**

HTTP is the Web's application layer protocol. It uses a client-server model. A client could be a web browser like firefox or safari, or it might be embedded in the device. The server sends objects in response to requests.



Take for instance a PC running Firefox. The client (Firefox) will send a kind HTTP request to the Web server. The Web server afterwards, if the world is at peace, will send back an HTTP response.

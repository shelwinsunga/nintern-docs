# SSH

Before we get into SSH, you need to know about *Telnet*. 

## Telnet

**Telnet**, which stands for **Teletype Network**, is a terminal emulation program that is used to access remote servers. In common language, it's just a tool in the command line that can give you access to servers from anywhere.
 
 You can administer or send commands to a server. Run programs, create folders, delete files, transfer files, create files, browser directories - it's much like if it was a device
 right in front of you. 




 You could also use Telnet to manage and configure other network devices like routers and switches, as well as check if ports are open or closed on a server. It's possible to run it
 on Windows and MacOS, but for the most part it lives in the linux ecosystem. 


The fatal flaw of telnet was that all commands were sent in clear text. Every command, every username or login you sent over, could be easily listened too and retrieved. The solution to this issue was
SSH.

 ## SSH

 **SSH** or **Secure Shell** will protect data from being attacked or stolen.  Unlike Telnet, it wil encrypt data, and provide password and public key authentication. In essence, 
 SSH does everything that Telnet does, just securely.

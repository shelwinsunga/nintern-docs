# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is the standard protocol we use to transfer files between computers and servers over a network. 


If I wanted to upload a file, let's call it `Nagios.txt`, I'd upload it to an FTP server. Other people who want `Nagios.txt` can connect to the FTP server and use the File Transfer Protocol
to download it to their devices. 

You don't absolutely need a dedicated FTP server, in fact you can configure your windows machine to work as an FTP server as well.

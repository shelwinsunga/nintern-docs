# Principles of the Application Layer

The application layer is where it all begins. The french would call it the network's **Raison d'Ãªtre**, or reason for being. Our goal is to understand the conceptual and practical aspects of the application layer. 

We'll also learn about protocols by looking at popular internet application-layer protocols and infrastructure. This includes HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, DNS, video streaming systems and CDNs.

## Creating a network application

It would seem that the overwhelming complexity of the internet would make developing programs on top of it impossible. But we can actually abstract away all that complexity.

When thinking about building an application, there are two styles that describe how the pieces of the app are going to work with each other. The first is the **client-server** paradigm, and the second is the **peer-to-peer** paradigm.

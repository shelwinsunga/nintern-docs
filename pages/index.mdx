# Nintern Docs Demo

The motivation for making this was mostly for myself: I wanted a way to study the terminology in a way that let me understood it a bit better. I thought giving myself the context necessary for that involved creating documentation as I learned it, so I went ahead and put what I'm learning about (Computer Networking) in here. It also stores all the terminology in a glossary-style directly taken from Steve's kindly produced pdf. Let me know if you think this is something that could be useful, otherwise I'll drop it.


## More details

I drew all of the illustrations/graphics in Figma, and created the website using a basic vercel deployment.

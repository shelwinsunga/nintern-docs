# Network Edge (Not necessary reading)

Earlier, we talked about how if we envisioned that the internet is some kind of closed shape, the edge of the shape would have devices we call **hosts**.

We're now going to get a deeper look into what happens at the network's edge.


## Access Network

Access Networks are the networks that connects the edge devices that we saw previously into the first router into the larger internet. We ask ourselves the question: How do we connect the end systems to the edge router?

There are three types of access networks: 

- Residential access networks
- Institutional access networks (school, company)
- Mobile access networks (WIFI, 4G/5G)

Things to keep in mind as you learn about access networks: 

- What is the transmission rate (bits/second) of each access network?
- Is the access shared or dedicated among users?

### Cable-based access 

In a cable-access network, a cable connects multiple homes to a single headend. These networks are usually **asymmetric**, meaning they transmit data faster in the downstream direction (to the home) rather than the upstream direction (from the home). This asymmetry reflects that people tend to be more consumers of data rather than producers of data.

Transmission rates

- Downstream (40 Mbps - 1.2 Gbs)
- Upstream (30-100 Mbps upstream transmission rate)

Cable-access networks are *shared*.

### Access networks: digital subscriber line (DSL)

DSL uses existing telephone lines and are connected  to whats called a *central office*.

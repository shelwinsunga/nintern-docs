# Protocols

## What is a protocol?

Maybe the easiest way to visualize protocols is to think about human protocols first. Humans execute protocols all the time:

- A human asks, "What's the time?" 

In this protocol, a person asks for the time, and someone else responds with the time. Here, we see that there is a **request** and there's a **reply**.

- A professor asks, "Are there any questions?" 

In this protocol, if a student doesn't have a question, then they might stare sullenly at their desk or stare at the ceiling. If a student does have a question, they will raise their hand and ask the question, and the professor will send a response. This is a multi-step human protocol. 

Can you think of any other protocols?

The anatomy of these human protocols consist of specific messages being sent, and then specific actions being taken when a message is received, or some other event.

### Network Protocols

It turns out that network protocols are analogous to human protocols. In a human protocol, there are phases like the greeting phase (saying hi to each other), the request phase (what time is it?), and the response phase (2pm).

And shortly, we'll see that network protocols function similarly: there's a connection request phase, followed by a request-response phase.

With this, we can come up with a pretty decent definition of a **protocol**.

    **Protocols** define the **format**, **order**, of **messages sent and received** among network entities, and **actions taken** on msg transmission, receipt.

## DHCP

**DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to any new node entering the network and managing nodes added/dropped from the network.



## HTTP

**HTTP** (hyper text transfer protocol) is a protocol that can be used on the internet
in order to control data transfer to/from a hosting server using a web browser.

It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protOcol, which means
requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout descriptions, images, videos, scripts, and more (MDN).

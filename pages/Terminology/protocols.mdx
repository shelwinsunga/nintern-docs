# Protocols

## What is a protocol?

Maybe the easiest way to visualize protocols is to think about human protocols first. Humans execute protocols all the time:

- A human asks, "What's the time?" 

In this protocol, a person asks for the time, and someone else responds with the time. Here, we see that there is a **request** and there's a **reply**.

- A professor asks, "Are there any questions?" 

In this protocol, if a student doesn't have a question, then they might stare sullenly at their desk or stare at the ceiling. If a student does have a question, they will raise their hand and ask the question, and the professor will send a response. This is a multi-step human protocol. 

Can you think of any other protocols?





## DHCP

**DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): a network management protocol used to dynamically assign an IP address to any new node entering the network and managing nodes added/dropped from the network.



## HTTP

**HTTP** (hyper text transfer protocol) is a protocol that can be used on the internet
in order to control data transfer to/from a hosting server using a web browser.

It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protOcol, which means
requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance, text, layout descriptions, images, videos, scripts, and more (MDN).

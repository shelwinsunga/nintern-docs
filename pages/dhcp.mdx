# DHCP

Every computer on a network has an IP address. This lets the network identify the device. There are two ways to be assigned an IP address:

- Static IP
- Dynamic IP

A **static** IP is when someone assigns an IP address manually. This was the original method we used in the advent of networking. Back in the day, we needed to manually input
IP addresses, Subnet masks, default gateways, and the DNS server. It was also important that each assigned IP address was *unique*, otherwise there'd be 
an IP conflict. In an IP conflict, the two conflicted computers wouldn't be able to access the network. 

A **dynamic** IP is where a computer gets its IP address from a DHCP server. A DHCP server automatically assigns an IP address, a subnet mask, a default gateway, and a DNS server.

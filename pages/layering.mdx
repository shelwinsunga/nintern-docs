## The internet sandwich

The layers of the internet breaks down as follows: At the top we have the **application layer**, followed by the **transport layer**, **network layer**, **link layer**, and **physical layer**.

The application layer holds the protocols for sending and receiving messages. The transport layer moves application layer messages from one place to another. The network layer transports data from one host to another, maybe reliably or maybe not depending on the service model. 


## Why layering?

Having a layered architecture lets us look at the different pieces of the system and their relationship to each other. Indeed, we have a clear **reference model** for talking about the system and the way they interact with each other.

We've also introduced modularization, which makes it much easier to maintain and update our system. Modularization means that changes we might make in the system doesn't necessarily change the system at large; if you changed the gate to the airlines, doesn't really affect ticketing, or baggage, or how planes take off.
